	Sprites are just images. They don't do anything. But objects in your game must
	perform actions. They must move around, react to mouse clicks, etc. So the next
	step is create some objects. We will start with the wall object.
	To add an object click on the <b>Resources</b> menu and press <b>Create Object</b>
	or click on the button with the blue ball.

	The form that appears might look a bit
	complicated but don't worry. It will soon become clear.
	</div>
	
	<div class="bodyText">	
	We first give the object an appropriate name <tt>obj_wall</tt>. Next,
	to give it the appropriate sprite, click on the menu icon to the right of <tt>&lt;no sprite&gt;</tt>
	and from the menu that appears select the wall sprite:
	</div>
	
	<br>
	<center><img src="01_objectsprite.png"></center>
	<br>
	

	<div class="bodyText">
	The wall object must be solid cause we do not want the fruit to move through it. To this end,
	press the checkbox <b>Solid</b> to select it. As the wall needs no further behavior, press the <b>OK</b>
	button to close the form. The wall object should now have appeared in the list at the left. Better
	save your work before continuing.
