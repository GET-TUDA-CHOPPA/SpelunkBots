	<div class="header">The Apple Object</div></div>
	
	<div class="bodyText">
	We are now going to create the apple object. Again press the button on the toolbar
	with the blue ball, to create a new object. Give the object as a name <tt>obj_apple</tt>
	and select the apple sprite for it. The apple is not solid. So the form should look as follows:
	</div>
		
	<br>
	<center><img src="01_objectapple.png"></center>
	<br>

	<div class="bodyText">
	Our apple object will need some behavior. First of all it must move around. And secondly
	it must react to mouse clicks. In <i>Game Maker</i> behavior is defined as follows: Objects 
	get <b>events</b>. An event happens when for example the object is created, when it collides with another
	object, and when the user presses the mouse button or a key on the keyboard. You can indicate that
	the object should react to certain events by executing <b>actions</b>. For example when the create event
	happen we can execute an action to start moving.
	</div>
	
	<div class="bodyText">
	In the object form, in the middle there is the list of events (empty at the moment). To the right
	of this there is the list of actions to be executed for the selected event. And at the far right there
	are six tabbed pages with all the different actions you can use.
	</div>
	
	<div class="bodyText">
	Our first step is to make sure the apple starts moving when it is created. Press the button <b>Add Event</b>.
	A form appears in which you select the <b>Create</b> event:
	</div>
	
	<br>
	<center><img src="01_eventcreate.png"></center>
	<br>

	<div class="bodyText">
	The event is added to the list. We can now include actions in this event by dragging them into the action
	list. Press and hold the mouse on the top-left action with the eight red arrow, drag it into the action list and
	release the mouse button. A form will appear in which you can indicate the directions of motion and the speed. Press
	all eight arrows to indicate the apple can move in any of these directions. As a speed, type in 8. Finally press 
	<b>OK</b>.
