	<div class="bodyText">
	We have now indicated that the apple, when it is created, should move in any of the eight directions with a speed
	of 8. Next we must make sure it bounces against the walls. For this we need a <b>collision event</b>.
	This happens when two objects collide with each other. 
	</div>

	<div class="bodyText">
	Press the button <b>Add Event</b> and in the form click on <b>Collision</b>. In the menu that appears select the 
	wall object.
	</div>
	
	<br>
	<center><img src="01_eventcollision.png"></center>
	<br>

	<div class="bodyText">
	The event is added to the list. Make sure it is selected. Now click the bounce action (the bottom right one) and
	drag it into the action list. In the form that appears simply press the <b>OK</b> button. 
	</div>
	
	<br>
	<center><img src="01_actionbounce.png"></center>
	<br>

	<div class="bodyText">
	Our final step is to make sure the player can press the mouse on the apple. In this case we want to
	move the apple to a random location (to make it harder for the user to press on it again) and we
	want to give the player some score. 
	</div>
	
	<div class="bodyText">
	Again press the <b>Add Event</b> button and in the form click on <b>Mouse</b>. In the menu select
	<b>Left pressed</b>. This event happens when the player presses the left mouse button on the object.
	Drag the <b>Jump to Random</b> action to the list. (You can see the name of an action by letting the
	mouse hover over the button). 
	</div>

	<br>
	<center><img src="01_actionjump.png"></center>
	<br>

	<div class="bodyText">
	In the form that appears simply press the <b>OK</b> button. This will make the apple jump to a 
	random location. Next we need to give the player some score. At the right of the form, select the
	tabbed page labeled <b>score</b>. A new set of actions appears. Drag the top-left <b>Set Score</b> action to
	the action list.
	In the form indicate a new score of 50. Now we do <b>not</b> want to set the score to 50 but
	we want to <b>add</b> 50 to the score. To this end click on the checkbox <b>Relative</b>.
	</div>
	
	<br>
	<center><img src="01_actionscore.png"></center>
	<br>

	<div class="bodyText">
	This concludes the definition of the apple. The event and action list should now look as follows.

	<br>
	
	<div class="bodyText">
	Press <b>OK</b> to close the object form. We now defined our two important objects: the wall and the
	apple, which are now both shown in the list at the left. Better save your work.
