	<div class="bodyText">
	Now that we have defined our wall and apple, we need to create a room in which to put them. 
	Rooms are what the player sees when he/she plays the game. Our game will need just one room
	but games made with <i>Game Maker</i> can have many different rooms. To create a room, click
	on the <b>Resources</b> menu and press <b>Create Room</b>
	or click on the corresponding button on the toolbar:
	</div>
	
	<br>
	<center><img src="01_roomadd.png"></center>
	<br>
	
	<div class="bodyText">
	The room form will appear. At the left there are three tabbed pages: objects, settings, backgrounds.
	Make sure <b>objects</b> is selected. At the right there is an empty area that is the actual room. If your
	screen is large enough, better scale the form such that the whole room is visible.
	</div>
	
	<div class="bodyText">
	We can now add objects to the room. At the bottom left, click on the menu icon and in the popup menu
	select the wall object:
	</div>
	
	<br>
	<center><img src="01_roomobject.png"></center>
	<br>
	
	<div class="bodyText">
	Now click with the left mouse button in the top left of the room area. An instance of the wall object
	should appear. Continue adding wall objects until you create a complete boundary around the room. If
	you make a mistake you can use the right mouse button to delete instances. 
	(If you want to do this faster, in the toolbar set the values of <b>Snap X</b> and <b>Snap Y</b> to 32, the
	size of the sprites, now you can draw multiple wall sprites by holding the &lt;Shift&gt; key.)
	</div>
	
	<div class="bodyText">
	Next we want to add some apples. Again click on the menu icon and in the popup menu
	select the apple object. Place two or three apple objects at random places in the room. 
	That finishes the game. Press the green checkmark sign in the toolbar of the room form to close it.
	</div>
