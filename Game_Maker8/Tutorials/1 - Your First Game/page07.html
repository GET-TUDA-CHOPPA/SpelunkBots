	Now it is time to test the game. Better save the game first. Click on the <b>Run</b> menu and press
	<b>Run normally</b> or press the green run button in the toolbar.

	If you followed the previous steps correctly the <i>Game Maker</i> window disappears and
	a window shows in which the apples move around. If they
	hit the wall they should bounce back. And if you manage to click with your mouse on one of the apples,
	you should see the score in the window caption increase and the apple jumps somewhere else.

	<div class="bodyText">
	Better check the game carefully. Do the apples move in different directions? If not you probably did not 
	create the correct <b>Create</b> event. Do they bounce of the walls? If not, you probably either did not
	make the walls solid or you did not create the correct <b>Collision</b> event. Can you click on them with
	the mouse and do you get some additional score? If not you must have made an error in the <b>Mouse press</b>
	event.

	You can switch the game to fullscreen mode by pressing F4. Press Esc to end the game and return the <i>Game Maker</i>.
