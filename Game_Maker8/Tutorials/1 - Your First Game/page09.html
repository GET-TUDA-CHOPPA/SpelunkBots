	Next we add a sound effect to the game. This effect must
	play when the player clicks on an apple. Click on the 
	<b>Resources</b> menu and press <b>Create Sound</b>
	or click on the button with the image of a speaker:

	<div class="bodyText">
	In the form that appears, give the sound an appropriate name and press the <b>Load Sound</b>
	button. 
	</div>

	<center><img src="01_soundload.png"></center>
	<br>

	<div class="bodyText">
	In the file selector that appears open the folder <tt>Tutorial1</tt> and in there double click
	on the sound file <tt>click.wav</tt>. If you do not see the folder <tt>Tutorial1</tt> you should
	navigate to the folder where <i>Game Maker</i> was installed. There you
	find a folder <tt>Sounds</tt> and in it you find the <tt>Tutorial1</tt> folder with the sound.
	</div>

	<div class="bodyText">
	Press <b>OK</b> to close the form. The sound should now be visible in the list at the left. We now need to
	make sure the sound is played when the player clicks on an apple. Reopen the apple object by double clicking
	on it in the list at the left.

	<div class="bodyText">
	Select the <b>Left Pressed</b> event, by clicking on it in the list of events. In the list
	of actions you will now see the jump and score actions. At the right of the form, select the tabbed page labeled 
	<b>main1</b>. A new set of actions appears. Drag the action with the speaker on it to the list of actions to play
	a sound.

	<br>

	<div class="bodyText">
	In the form that appears, select as a sound the click sound (click with 
	the mouse on the top menu icon to select the sound). Make
	sure to keep the value of <b>loop</b> to false as we want the sound to play only once. Next press the <b>OK</b>
	button. The action list should now look as follows:

	<div class="bodyText">
	Again press <b>OK</b> to close the object form. Save and play the game, and now the sound should
	play whenever you click on an apple.
