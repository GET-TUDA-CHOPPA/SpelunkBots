	<div class="header">Adding Bombs</div></div>

	<div class="bodyText">
	Although the game can already be fun to play, there is something missing. You cannot lose! 
	You can just keep clicking randomly, which is not really much fun. Hence, we are going to add
	bombs to the game. If you click on a bomb you will lose and the game will end. Bombs will be static.
	They won't move, but their number keeps increasing to make the game more and more difficult over time.
	</div>
	
    <div class="bodyText">
	The bomb sprite is already present but we atill need a sound effect for it. Press the button with the
	speaker to add a sound. Give is an appropriate name, press the <b>Load Sound</b> button and select
	<tt>explosion.wav</tt>. Press <b>OK</b> to close the sound form.
	</div>

	<div class="bodyText">
	Now create the bomb object by clicking on the
	blue ball button. Give the object an appropriate name and the bomb sprite. We want the bomb to
	appear in a random place. To this end, add the <b>Create</b> event. In it place the action to jump
	to a random location.
	</div>

	<div class="bodyText">
	When the use clicks on it we want the game to end. So add the <b>Mouse</b> event <b>Left pressed</b>.
	As a first action we want to play the explode sound so add the play sound action (from the <b>main1</b> tab)
	and select the explode sound. Next we want to wait a little while to let the player realize he lost.
	From the <b>main2</b> tab, drag the sleep action (with the zzz on it) and place it <b>below</b> the play sound
	action. The default values are fine, so press <b>OK</b>.  
	</div>

	<div class="bodyText">
	As a next step we want to show a highscore list. This is very easy in <i>Game Maker</i>. From the <b>score</b> 
	tab, drag the show highscore action (with the 1,2,3 in it). In the form you can set quite some values. As
	a background you can choose the wood background. You also can change the colors and the font if you like, for
	example as follows: 
	</div>

	<br>
	<center><img src="01_actionhigh.png"></center>
	<br>

	<div class="bodyText">
	As a final step we need the action to restart the game, which can be found in the <b>main2</b> tab. The action
	list should now look as follows: 
	</div>
	
	<br>
	<center><img src="01_actionlose.png"></center>
	<br>

	<div class="bodyText">
	Make sure the order of the actions is correct. (If not, drag them to the correct location.)
	That finishes the bomb object so better press the <b>OK</b> button to close the form.
	To test the game, place one or two bomb objects in the room. Save the game, run it, catch some
	fruit and then click on a bomb. An explosion sound should be heard and the highscore list should show.
	Note that in this list you can add your name if you get a new high score.
