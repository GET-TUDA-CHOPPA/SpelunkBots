	<div class="bodyText">
	To make the game more difficult we want to create additional bombs while playing the game.
	We can create a new object to do this but we can as well use the music object for this. So
	reopen the music object by double clicking on it in the list at the left.
	</div>

	<div class="bodyText">
	To create the bombs we will use alarm clocks. You can set these clocks to a particular value and
	they will then tick down to 0. Once they reach 0 an <b>Alarm</b> event will happen. To initialize
	the alarm clock, go to then <b>main2</b> tab and drag the top left action (with the clock image)
	to the action list (below the play sound action). As <b>number of steps</b> indicate a value of 60.
	A second is 30 steps so we will add a new bomb every 2 seconds. Make sure alarm 0 is selected.
	</div>

	<div class="bodyText">
	Now press <b>Add Event</b>, click on the <b>Alarm</b> events and select in the menu <b>Alarm 0</b>.
	In this event we will create the bomb. Go to the <b>main1</b> tab and drag the top left action in the 
	action list (the lightbulb). Click on the menu icon and select the bomb object.
	</div>

	<div class="bodyText">
	There is no need to set a position as the bomb will anyway jump to a random position. Next we must set the
	alarm clock again. So add the alarm action (from the <b>main2</b> tab) and set alarm 0 again to 60. This
	will repeat the proces. So the action list now looks as follows:
	</div>

	<br>

	<div class="bodyText">
	Close the object form, save the game, and run it. You should see more and more bombs appearing and eventually
	you will click on one of them and the game will end. If you want to make the game a bit harder, you can also
	let the bombs move slowly. You should by now know how to achieve that.
