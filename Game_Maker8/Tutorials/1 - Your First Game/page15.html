	If it did not really work correctly, you can always load the game from the <tt>Examples</tt> folder. Once the game
	is ready you might want to give it to your friends. But they might not have <i>Game Maker</i>. To this end
	go to the <b>File</b> menu and click on <b>Create Executable</b>. Indicate the name (and location)
	and press <b>Save</b>. You will now have a stand-alone game that you can give to everybody to play.

	<div class="bodyText">
	You have learned about the most important elements of <i>Game Maker</i>: sprites, backgrounds, sounds, music,
	objects, events, actions, and rooms. You should now be able to start making your own games. But there is a
	lot more to learn. You can check the help file or you can read some more tutorials. And there even are 
	books about <i>Game Maker</i>. You can access all this information through the <b>Help</b> menu. Enjoy!
